# Design

The original intention of the design of this component library is to highly reproduce pages.

## Inspiration

The writing and launch of a component requires inspiration, which means that the component is either highly useful and reusable, complex to build, or has a high degree of sensory beautification.

## Contrast

I don't redesign a complete set of UI like Element Plus or Ant Design, I only write and publish for special UI layouts.

If you are interested in a UI interface that needs to be implemented and has the aforementioned "inspiration" premise, please submit <a href="https://github.com/iqseternal/suey-rokcetry/issues">ISSUE</a>
